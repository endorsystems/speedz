# Speedzzzz Testing ISP Speed
A SUPER simple script to check the speed using Speedtest.net servers.

Looks like pyspeedtest hasn't been updated since 2016 and is broken.

- Working on updating this to use speedtest-cli module
https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/wiki

Install requirements
- pip install -r requirements

** Python 3
